# My Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

This project, tests the User's basic knowledge of the core languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As a full stack developer, being able manipulate the DOM and understanding how to use JavaScript is very essential when it comes to having a User interacting with your webpage. Being able to create a simple quiz, tests my skills as a developer to help guide the user on their choices and to help myself understand them.

Things I have learned is that, when it comes to HTML, and CSS those are my strongest areas since I love the creativity to design and style my webpage to my liking. Although JavaScript can do the same as in being able to have full control with the functionality. I found out that JavaScript was one of my weaknesses, testing my problem solving skills. Doing this challenge, definitely helped me improve on my problem skills, but of course there is always room for improvement!
